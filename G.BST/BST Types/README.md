# BST Types

## `Binary Tree`
**Tree which no node can have more than 2 children `[0 or 1 or 2 childrens]`**

## `Binary Search Tree [BST]`
**Binary Tree with additional properties**
- For each node n the values of each node in its `left sub-tree` are **`smaller`** than n
- For each node n the values of each node in its `right sub-tree` are **`bigger`** than n
- Can not have duplicates. Tree values are unique

## `Full Binary Tree`
**Binary Tree in which all nodes have 0 or 2 children**

Binary Tree in which 
- Has all levels completely filled with nodes except the last level
- In the last level, all the nodes are on the left side as possible.
