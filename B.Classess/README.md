# Classess

## `Access Modifiers`
- `private` cannot be accessed outside the class
- `public` can be access any where in the program
- Convention is to make the fields private and the methods public

## `Constructor`
- Method that describes how an instance of the class is constructed
- Used  to initialize the data of an object of a class
- Same name as class name
- Cannot return anything not even void
- If no constructor is explicitly defined the default [no-arg] constructor will be invoked automatically
- Class can have more than one constructor which is different in signature [method overloading]
- In C++ if you do not initialize the variables using a constructor they will take garbage value </br>
instead of Java which assigns default values for each variable
```cpp

```
